  "description": "RoleMaster D100 Generator is a configurable script for generating d100 rolls according to RoleMaster explosion rules. Rolls can be high open-ended, low open-ended, open-ended in both directions (the default), with the option to allow multiple change of directions (see Help by sending the following command through chat: !rmd100 --help). Use the Config panel to set script-level parameters, or command line arguments to apply settings to a single roll. This script is set up to work as a metascript, feeding the resulting roll into another script's command line, if you need it. More details are in the Help panel.\r\rFor more information, see the original thread in the API forum:\r\r[RoleMasterD100 Forum Thread](https://app.roll20.net/forum/permalink/10917965/)",
