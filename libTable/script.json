  "description": "libTable provides an easy interface for interacting with rollable table objects. The rows of a table can be returned as an object keyed by the row name, keyed on a 1-for-1 index, keyed on a weighted index (where a weight of 3 becomes 3 entries of the same data), keyed on an open-ended index (utilizing >, <, >=, <=, or ranges), or an object that contains all of this information. Pass in a rollabletable name or a rollabletable object to the exposed function.",
